# Madden Player Stats Importer

A way to automate the career and season stats for Madden '20.

## Retrieving

### Login

For career stats, this program pulls from [StatHead](https://stathead.com), and it requires a paid subscription to access all datarows. You can provide your username and password in two ways:

1. Use the `-u (username)` and `-p (password)` command-line arguments while running the program; or
2. Create a file in the root directory called `login.private` with two lines. The first line is your username, and the second line is your password.

**The program will not save your username and / or password. You must either create a file or enter the information every time you run the program.**

### From source

If you want to save the data as an Excel file, use

```bash
dotnet run -p MaddenImporter.Excel/ -- [-y year] [--path path] [--career] [-u username] [-p password]
```

If you wish to use a different file format, the `MaddenImporter` class library contains all the necessary functions and data.

### Pre-built

The executable file for your operating system can be found on the Releases page. We support Windows x64, macOS x64, Linux x64, and Linux ARM. If you are using an ARM-based machine, you may need to build the geckodriver executable from the source code.

```bash
./maddenimporter.excel(.exe) [-y year] [--path path] [--career] [-u username] [-p password]
```
